To install:

1)  Customise lspf.h  Make sure paths ZSPROF, ZUPROF, MLIB etc exist.
2)  Compile and run setup.cpp to create the default ISPSPROF profile member, ISPCMDS and USRCMDS command tables.
3)  Compile lspf.cpp
4)  Compile applications
5)  Copy directories mlib, plib and tlib to the paths defined in MLIB, PLIB and TLIB in lspf.h if different.
    If using keylists, make sure key table file ISRKEYP in the tlib/ directory is in the ZUPROF directory (usually ~/.lspf/)

You can use comp1 to compile lspf.cpp, compsetup to compile setup.cpp and compapps for all applications in directory Apps
This has been developed on Arch Linux - link options may vary (eg. if ncurses is built with --with-termlib add -ltinfo )

Boost and ncurses required to compile lspf.cpp

OOREXX required for POREXX1.cpp (OOREXX interface module for writing lspf applications in REXX) and PEDRXM1.cpp (edit
macro interface module for writing edit macros in REXX)

file required for PBRO01A.cpp as it is linked with -lmagic

Run lspf in a terminal

Works with:
gcc 7.2.1
ncurses 6.0
boost 1.65.1
