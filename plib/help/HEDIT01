Help for the PEDIT01 editor


EDIT Entry Panel
*--------------*

The File Name field supports NRETRIEV, referral lists and file/directory name expansion.
A generic can also be used in the low level file name eg /data/src/*ed*cpp where * represents
any number of characters, including 0.  In this case a file list will be shown regardless
of the Show directory list setting.  (Infact any valid regex can be used as long as it contains
'*', '?' or '[' somewhere in the name)

Initial Macro      - Initial macro to run after the data has been read but before it is displayed.

Profile Name       - Name of the profile to use for the edit session to override the default.

Line Command Table - Name of the line command table for user line commands.  Table can be
                     created using rexx edittab1.


Extensions to the normal ISPF PDF editor primary commands:
*--------------------------------------------------------*

PROFILE USE TYPE - Determine profile name from the file type (eg, REXX, ASM, CPP)
                   (PROFILE name switches this off and reverts to an explicit profile name)
                   Explicit profile names are in red (as is the explicit hilight language)

PROFILE DELETE abc - Delete edit profile abc

RECOVER ON PATH pathname - Set the path to save a copy of the file on edit entry
                           (default home directory - should be changed to a backup directory eg ~/isr/)

UNDO ALL - Undo all changes on the undo stack
REDO     - Redo the last undo
REDO ALL - Redo all changes on the redo stack
           If UNDO/REDO line is not on the screen, the top line is repositioned to show
           the UNDO/REDO line (this may be a delete action so no line will be visible in this case)

           UNDO ALL will go back to the last save for 'SETUNDO ON' or back to the start of
           the edit session for 'SETUNDO KEEP'

L UNDO/REDO - Locate an UNDO or REDO line
L T         - Locate marked text (alises MRK, MARK, MARKED)
L *         - Jump back to the previous LOCATE line

CUT MARKED  - Copy marked text to the clipboard

RESET T     - Reset marked text (alises MRK, MARK, MARKED)

XTABS ON    - Convert tabs to spaces on file read, and spaces to tabs on file save
      OFF   - Don't convert tabs

XTABS nnn   - Set tab size
