Saved File List application.
===========================

Field File name supports file name expansion using either field Directory or Current, whichever is non-blank, to
retrieve the list of files.  This field also supports NRETRIEV.  Entries begining with a '/' will be treated asis and
will not be prefixed with the Directory or Current fields.

Directory field supports directory name expansion and the saved list fields below Current support
name expansion also.

Execute primary command FIELDEXC with the cursor on the required field to activate this function.  Assign this
command to a function key to make this simpler.  The tab key can also be used for this.

The saved list is cursor sensitive.  To retrieve an entry, place cursor on the field and press ENTER, or select the
line with the C command.

An '*' in the File Name field will give a listing of the Directory or Current fields

Line commands:
B  - Browse file
C  - Make entry the current entry
E  - Edit file
L  - List directory
S  - Select entry (list for directory, browse for file)
