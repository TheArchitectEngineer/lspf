Saved File List application.

Field File name supports file name expansion using either field Directory or Current, whichever is non-blank, to 
retrieve the list of files.

Directory field supports directory name expansion and the saved list fields below Current support
name expansion also.


Execute primary command FIELDEXC with the cursor on the required field to activate this function.  Assign this
command to a function key to make this simpler.

line with the C command.

Line commands:
B  - Browse file
C  - Make entry the current entry
E  - Edit file
L  - List directory
S  - Select entry (list for directory, browse for file)
