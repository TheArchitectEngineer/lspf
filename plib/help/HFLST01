Primary and line commands for file list application PFLST01
===========================================================


The Entry name field is cursor sensitive.  Placing the cursor on a line within then Entry name column
and pressing ENTER will show a file list if the entry is a directory name, or edit the file if the entry
is a regular file.

Place cursor on Path Name and execute primary command FIELDEXC for directory name completion.
(Assign FIELDEXC to a PF key to make this easier).  This function is cursor sensitive, so only characters
before the cursor will be taken into account (if cursor is on the first position, all the field is used).
Partial directory names will be expanded to the first match and then the next directory entry in
the list will be retrieved.

A '?' on the first character of the directory name (and command FIELDEXC), will give a scrollable
list to navigate the file system.

Panel supports REFLIST and NRETRIEV functions.
