Only a subset of the file tailoring statements have currently been implemented.

)ENDDOT

)DO n
)ENDDO

)DO VAR = n TO m BY x FOR y WHILE | UNTIL expr
)ENDDO

)NOP

)REXX

)SEL A op B && C op D | E op F ....
)ENDSEL

)SET A = expr

)TB
)TB  nA n
)TBA n  n

Conditional substitution has been implemented.


Notes:
------
1) Built-in functions are not implemented.

2) )IF, )ELSE and )SETF are not implemented.

3) Continuation via the ? character, is not implemented.

4) Conditional processing of the )DEFAULT statement is not supported for the
   control or variable characters (first two characters).  If the )DEFAULT statement is performed
   conditionally and either of these is changed, results will probably be incorrect.
