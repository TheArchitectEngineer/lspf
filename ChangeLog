Changelog
=========

Release 1.2.0
-------------
o) Add SWAPBAR

o) Add PFKEY display area.

o) RETP can now be filtered and is scrollable.  CTRL-S displays a keep list of commands (See help for all actions).

o) Handle resizing of the terminal window.

o) Optional decolourise all lspf panels when terminal window loses focus (set in opt 0.0).  Only works if ncurses passes
   kxIN and kxOUT for the event.

o) Redirect cerr and cout to the application log.

o) Various extra key combinations if the console/emulator supports them:
   eg. CTRL-RIGHT - move cursor to next word in a field.
       CTRL-SHIFT-DELETE - delete word cursor is on.
       ALT-DELETE - delete spaces up to the next non-blank.
       ALT-UP     - Retrieve command from stack.
       ALT-DOWN   - Retrieve forward command from stack.
       See help for full list.

o) Mouse actions with configuration dialogue (opt 0.12)

o) Scrollable fields.

o) Field history support.  New SETVERB command ZHISTORY displays field history for the field the cursor on, if supported in the
   panel with the new .HIST panel control variable (See opt 0.0 for an example (Default edit line command table) and opt 3.6
   Compare utility).
   Command ZHISTORY is not active for fields that are not defined in the .HIST control variable - message PSYS011 will be issued
   for these.
   Also add new CONTROL options, CONTROL HISTORY UPDATE/NOUPDATE and lspf General Settings option to activate/deactivate globally.

o) Multi-line table displays.  Up to 8 model lines can be defined for each table row.

o) PANEXIT LOAD support (see panload1.cpp testing program).

o) PANEXIT REXX support.

o) Panel REXX support.

o) Add TBSTATS service.

o) Add QBASELIB service.

o) Add QUERYENQ service.

o) Add DSINFO service.

o) Allow variable names in column and length fields for the TBFIELD statement.  (Not supported for the TBTEXT statement).

o) File tailoring support.

o) Add trace macro TRACE_FUNCTION() for trace_logger class (only active with DEBUG2 defined).

o) Support ATTR() parameter in FIELD statement to refer to )ATTR section instead of inline.

o) Make panel statements .ATTR and .ATTRCHAR more consistent with ISPF (see below).

o) VEDIT panel statement.

o) Allow dynamic areas in a scroll area.

o) Add many missing EDIT macro statements.

o) Add EDIT macros pstore and PEDUMAC1 for profile selection based on file entry patterns (see Edit help).

o) Add EDIT BACKUP mode to create backup on first update (old EDIT RECOVERY).
   Easy access to backups using the 'backups' edit macro.  See backups ? for help.

o) Add EDIT/BROWSE RECLEN parameter.  (Delete any old EDRT's so EDIT RECOVERY picks up RECLEN - see below).

o) EDIT software/hardware/logical tabbing.

o) Edit macros can now be written in C++.  See example PTESTM1.cpp and PEDUMAC1.cpp for Edit profile selection.

o) Add highlighing languages COBOL, JCL, skeleton, bash, rust, toml, diffu, diffc.

o) Edit setting to change language element highlighing colours.

o) Add overflow variables on dynamic areas so data can be inserted/deleted past right margin without scrolling.
   Editor updated to use this feature.

o) View lspf tables utility (opt 3.10).

o) Display system information such as mounts, disks, tasks, USB, network, systemd etc. (opt 5).

o) Say/pull/trace/interactive debug from REXX now call relevant pApplication method.  EXECs changed to use these.

o) Add similar help system to ISPF's help.

o) Add a simple TSO-like environment to support EXECIO in REXX.  lspf services that use the LIBRARY() parameter, can now
   use an allocated ddname as well as a lib-type LIBDEF.
   Use REXX DDLIST to display ddnames and enqueues.

o) Add a number of Library Management services.  EDIT, VIEW and BROWSE can now use these.

o) Implement panel model statement ROWS(SCAN).

o) Add ALTLIB command to alter/display search paths for REXX.

o) Support native ISPF panels.


Notes and Actions Required for release 1.2.0
--------------------------------------------

1) .ATTR and .ATTRCHAR are more consistent with ISPF so it is no longer possible to directly change CUA attributes.  They
    can still be changed if the TYPE is also changed.
    eg. ATTR(.CURSOR) = 'TYPE(INPUT) COLOUR(RED)'

2) Panel section order is now checked and enforced.

3) Edit recovery needs to know if the RECLEN parameter was specified.  Two new fields have been added to the Edit Recovery Table,
   ZEDRECFM and ZEDLRECL.  Old EDRT's should be deleted when any recoveries have completed so the EDRT is recreated with the
   new fields.  EDRT's can be found in the ZUPROF directory (normally HOME/.lspf), with names of the form profileEDRT.  ISREDRT is
   the usual one used.

4) Edit has a new format for the profile table to accommodate RECLEN.  Run REXX convprof to convert them, or delete the old Edit profiles.
